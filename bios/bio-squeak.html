      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>
- mad scientist/doctor named Squeak.<br> 
- Sometimes speaks in 3's(ex. yes yes yes, no no no, silly silly silly)<br>
- Giggly<br>
- Maniacal<br>
- Likes bones (they keep the best as trophies. The hyoid bone is special)<br>
- Chaotic neutral. She doesn't really care if it's right or wrong, as long as she gets a bone after.<br>
- Happy enough family. Grew up middle-class with loving parents. She's just off her rocker and we don't know why. <br>
- Mind wanders and sometimes doesn't listen when she should.<br>
