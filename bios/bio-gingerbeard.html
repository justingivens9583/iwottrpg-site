      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>

LL, a dwarf of unknown parentage, grew up in the Mithril Hall orphanage, unsure if his parents died or abandoned him—a question he never sought to answer. His name, LL, remains a mystery, likely an alphabetical designation from the orphanage. As an adolescent, he joined the stonemasons’ guild, where he mastered rune carving. Unlike his peers, who revered their ancestors, LL lived a secular life, detached from his unknown lineage. <br><br>
After a dragon attack devastated the modest town where he had established a stoneworking and runecarving business, LL began traveling. During his journeys, he uncovered ancient runes and began practicing them with his trusty hammers. One day, while carving these runes, Moradin—the Soul Forger, Dwarffather, and Allhammer—spoke to him, promising abundant blessings if LL devoted himself to the Dwarven God. From that moment, LL dedicated his hammers and heart to Moradin’s service, his craft infused with divine purpose.<br><br>
Now a skilled runecarver and mason, LL earns a living through his trade. He recently joined the Iron Wolves Organization as a merchant, traveling and working alongside the guild to build a new life, his faith in Moradin guiding his path.
