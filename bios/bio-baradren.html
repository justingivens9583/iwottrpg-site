      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>
Baradren was born in the shadow of the Greypeak Mountains, the son of a Silvan elf scout and a human trapper. His mother vanished when he was young, returning to her people at her family's behest beyond the forest’s edge, leaving him to be raised by his father among harsh winters, wolf packs, and winding mountain trails. From his father, Baradren learned the ways of tracking and survival; from his absent mother’s memory, he inherited a quiet sense of longing and the gift of elven perception.  He perhaps is too eager to please his female compatriots and acquaintances.<br><br>

He became a guide for caravans due to his proficiency and knowledge of the steep passes—living up to his surname “Steger,” the “steep-path walker,” he even was referred to cordially by the gruff dwarves who hired his services. Yet his life turned when a cultist band ambushed a merchant train he was leading. Many died—including a young knight who’d trusted Baradren’s pathfinding and was seriously considering making him his official squire. Baradren fought off the cultists, but the loss broke him. Convinced his failure had cost innocent lives, he considered vanishing into the wilds to atone... but alas that wasn't his fate.<br><br>

Joining the Iron Wolves Organization
The slain knight was a hedge knight named Varric Dane building his renown and honor in the company of the Iron Wolves Organization.  At the time he was traveling with another Wolf named Obadiah Clementine.  After the ambush and with the knowledge that Varric had grown fond of Baradren, Obadiah suggested that he travel on and submit himself as a new recruit.  Interested in adventure, seeking some vengeance on any other evil dragon cultist groups, and perhaps a glimmer of hope of reuniting with his mother at some point he seeks to adventure to all corners of the globe and see where his life-path will lead.
