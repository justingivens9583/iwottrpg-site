      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>
His Father is a noble human, and his Mother is an Orc adventurer. They met on one of her many adventures that she chooses not to share many details of, he swept her off of her feet with his sweet and caring nature and shortly after she chose to end her adventuring life.  She was shunned from her family for marrying a human leading Perkas to grow up exclusively around humans. <br><br>
His father always had an interest in the arcane but could never use magic himself though the love transferred to Perkas who chose to enroll in a wizarding school and quickly found he had a natural talent for it.
