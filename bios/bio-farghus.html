      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>
Farghus Suregrip, firstborn of Farghus and Gurdis Suregrip, had always felt the touch of divinity upon him. As a boy, he believed without question that he would one day answer the call of the Dwarffather and become a Hammer of Moradin. His parents encouraged this dream—at least until they realized their son possessed neither the patience nor the scholarly mind required for the clergy.<br><br>

Impetuous, stubborn, and defiant of authority, Farghus constantly butted heads with his teachers, the temple clerics, and even his own kin. Long days spent tending to the family’s mushroom farm did little to calm his restless spirit. Worse still, his unruly attitude began to rub off on his younger brothers—Ferghus, Firghus, Forghus, and Furghus.<br><br>

Fearing the chaos their eldest might sow if left unchecked, his parents sent him to a nearby military academy, hoping discipline might succeed where prayer and hard labor had failed. But Farghus found no peace there either. The lessons of strategy and tactics slid off him like water off stone, and his thick-headedness earned him the ire of his instructors. His peers mocked him for his lowly birth—what place had a simple mushroom farmer among the sons and daughters of noble clans?<br><br>

Yet there was one place where Farghus excelled beyond all expectation: the practice yard. In single combat, none could best him. He discovered that disputes—whether over respect, rank, or pride—could be settled most efficiently at the edge of a blade. Recognizing his raw potential, his weary instructors began sending him on increasingly dangerous field exercises, if only to keep him occupied.<br><br>

It was during his first training mission above the stone halls of home that fate found him. Most dwarves, when they first see the open sky, are struck with vertigo, fearing they might tumble upward into the boundless blue. But when Farghus looked to the heavens, he felt as though a heavy shroud had been lifted from his shoulders. For the first time in his life, he could breathe freely. The vastness did not terrify him—it called to him. In that moment, he felt the pull of that divine presence more than ever before.<br><br>

Despite his family’s protests, Farghus left the academy, left the mountains, and left behind everything he knew. He took to the surface world, determined to uncover the destiny that had eluded him in the deep. Before long, he joined a mercenary company, where his skill with arms quickly earned him a place among hardened veterans. Traveling up and down the Sword Coast, Farghus sought battle, glory, and—above all—the divine purpose that had whispered to him since childhood.
