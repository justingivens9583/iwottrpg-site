      <p>
Life is funny sometimes, dontcha know.  

One day I’m baling hay and tending the cattle and next thing ya know I’m up to my sniff-sifter in goblin giblets and broken arrows.  Whole pack of the little devils came tearing through my farm right after sundown trying to steal all my chickens and scaring the cows.  I tolds ‘em it was a bad idea and they best be getting about their own business.  Live and let lives I always says.

Well, they didn’t listen or maybe they just couldn’t understands me so they kept after my chickens.  “Last warnin’” I yells at ‘em.  “Git off my farm or I’ll have to come out there and have words with ya.”  Well, dontcha know, now they starts running towards me at the farm house, screaming like the devil’s own mama and shooting arrows at me.  Well now I has ta do something about it.  Can’t let the little goblins have the run of my farm.  So I heads inside, grab a hammer I’d been using to hang some shelves and the splitting ax by the fire and heads back outside to deal with the little demons.  

The first ones went quick enough.  I tolds them I didn’t want to hurt them but they gaves me no choice.  I bashed one right ov’r his ear and the second I managed to crack his head with the ax.  Sounded just like an egg hitting the cobblestones.  Gosh darn, I felts bad doing it, but they just kepts coming.  Two more weres right behind the first two swinging those little swords they like so much.  Well, I had to defends myself, so they went down right next to the first two.  I pointed with my hammer at the rest of them and says “ I don’t want to come to out there but if you lot don’t get away from my farm, I’ll have to come out there and keeps whacking your skulls.  Now, I don’t know if they understood my words, but the blood dripping off my hammer and ax sure spoke to ‘em yo betcha.  They turned tail and ran like Tempus hisself was coming after ‘em.  A few still had some chickens with them, but on the whole I didn’t lose too much.  

I figures if they were coming on my farm, it’s a good bet they on others too, so I popped up on ol’ Ella Mae and rode off to check on the Yoder’s down the road.  Sure enough, they’d come over here too.  Looked like them goblins was tryin to chase the little ones, sos I kicked Ella into a sprint and let her big hooves grind those little trouble-makers into the ground.  She rode over four them without even slowing down.  Supposed I should tells you, good Ella Mae ain’t no race horse, minds you.  She’s a draft horse I raised since a colt.  Seventeen hands and two thousand pounds if she’s an an inch.  I don’t even think she knew she was stepping on anything other than some sticks in the mud.  

I pulled the young’uns onto Ella with me and kept riding for the big house.  Weren’t a nice sight whens we got there, no siree.  Ma Yoder was bleeding something fierce and Pa… well Pa Yoder had pulled his last weed as we say around here.  Luckly, we’d made quite a sight coming across the fields and the goblins decided they didn’t want the bottom end of ol’ Ella like the others had so they ran off into the dark.

I stayed the night at the Yoders, patched up Ma as best I could and tried to keep the young’uns occupied.  Brought Pa into the house when we felt is was safe and wrapped him up proper.  Little ones were crying something fierce you betcha, but I’d told ‘em their Pa was resting safe now, and they’d be able to see him again someday.  Life is funny sometimes.  But sometimes it’s sad too.  

Come morning, I rode into town and sure enough, those little rascals had hit almost a dozen farms during the night.  

Lot of hurt folk.  

Lot of last weeds pulled.

Those of us that were able posse’d up.  Decided we couldn’t just sit by and let a goblin raid go by.  Wouldn’t be right and wouldn’t feel safe again knowing those little scamps were still on the loose.  

Now, I don’t like hurting and only do killing when needs to, so I’ll just say we found where those little imps were sleeping and saw to it they didn’t wake up again.  

Soon afterwards, the seniors in the town comes up to me and says, “Gods gave you the gift of helping people.  Seen how you killed those goblins.  Reckon you took three for every one another man got.  Those that have gifts are obligated to use ‘em.  You could help a lot of people and there’s plenty of people that need helping in this world.”

Thought about that the whole ride back to my farm.  Figured they were right.  If there’s people that need helping and I can help, welp…  I supposed I has ta help ‘em.  Didn’t take long to pack my things.  I weren’t married yet and didn’t have a big farm.  Took my hammer and ax I used to drive those goblins away.  Felt like they wouldn’t be used for driving nails and splitting wood anymore.  Gave ol’ Ella Mae to Ma Yoders.  Told her I’d be around when I could to help on the farm and bring Ella some carrots.  Gave the young’uns some hugs and told ‘em to help their mama as best they could.  

Gonna make my way to the nearest big city.  Musts be some other folks like me out there, wanting to help those that can’t help themselves.  Maybes together we can help a whole bunch of folks, you betcha.
