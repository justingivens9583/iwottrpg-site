      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>
Once a captain of the Berdusk city guard, Tharion Voss earned a reputation for his unwavering sense of duty and a voice that could command a battlefield. His men followed him not out of fear, but out of trust — a rare quality in a world of coin and chaos.<br><br>

Years ago, during a raid on a merchant caravan, Tharion’s patrol arrived too late. Dozens lay dead — guards, travelers, even children. The perpetrators were never caught, but it became clear to Tharion that law and politics had limits. City walls could not protect those who walked the roads between them.<br><br>

So he left his post. With a handful of loyal companions, he founded the Iron Wolves Organization — a guild of sellswords, scouts, and guardians dedicated to protecting the roads and the people who travel them. Their creed: the strength of the pack is the strength of all.<br><br>

Under Tharion’s leadership, the Iron Wolves became more than mercenaries. They became a symbol of reliability — the folk between cities who stand their ground when bandits, beasts, or worse strike from the shadows. Tharion himself is a weathered half-elf, his once-dark hair streaked with gray, his armor practical but worn with pride. A long scar runs down his left cheek — a reminder of a wyvern ambush near Elturel.<br><br>

Now, as whispers spread of increased raids and dragons sighted on the horizon, Tharion has grown uneasy. He’s seen how small threats build toward calamity. The Iron Wolves have been hired to escort a caravan to Greenest — but Tharion suspects this is only the beginning of something far greater.<br><br>

He spends his nights in the guild’s war room, poring over maps by candlelight, a wolf-headed pendant resting against his chest — the same one he gives to every new recruit as a symbol of loyalty and purpose.
