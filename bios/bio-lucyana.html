  <h2>Backstory</h2>
  <p>
Talented leather worker and is just all around a nice person. She's made quite a living for herself in the BDSM community with her quality work and friendly demeanor. She met Idris and fell hard without realizing he was a deity. He had never been with a mortal and was quite surprised to find out how very fragile they are and it stresses him out. He imbibes her with magic and gives her a ring that is his secret amulet that enables him to enter a pact linking them. She knows, but lets him think it's still a secret because she thinks it's cute.
