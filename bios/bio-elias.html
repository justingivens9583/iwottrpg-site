      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>
Elias was raised as an orphan in a small temple of Mystra in the city of Berdusk, where the priests encouraged curiosity and experimentation with magic. As a child, he accidentally enchanted the temple’s cat to recite poetry for a week straight—a mistake that made him a local legend and convinced him that Mystra herself had a sense of humor.<br><br>

When he came of age, he traveled the land as a “wandering celebrant of the Weave,” bringing light shows and harmless magical spectacles to small villages. He became something of a magical troubadour, using his talents to entertain, educate, and inspire awe in people who might otherwise fear magic. Busking also lead to the occasional quest to assist a royal with retrieving a rare book or artifact from dangerous temples and deep dang dungeons.  On one of these such adventures he first encountered the Iron Wolves Organization.<br><br>

For the past five years, however, Elias' dreams have been haunted by visions of dark wings blotting out the sky and the Weave trembling under the weight of draconic greed. He believes Mystra herself is warning him and lead him to this next part of his adventure —and so he’s joined the company known as the Iron Wolves to investigate and stop whatever evil threatens the balance of magic.<br><br>

To Elias, the Iron Wolves are both protectors and potential friends in this great cosmic story. He views their mercenary contracts as adventures rather than jobs—and he often sprinkles his spells with improvised flourishes, declaring each battle a “performance in Mystra’s honor".
