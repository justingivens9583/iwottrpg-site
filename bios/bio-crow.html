      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>
Crow, once a nameless Aarakocra with sleek black feathers and piercing eyes, served as a scout for his flock in the high mountain ranges. Tasked with surveilling the lands below, he encountered a human caravan carrying a dazzling ancient artifact, possibly linked to a Cult. Succumbing to its allure, he stole it, betraying his tribe’s trust and triggering his exile. The Cult retaliated, attacking his flock and causing severe devastation while seeking the artifact.<br><br> 
Now grounded, Crow has transformed his aerial agility into the skills of a rogue, moving through the world in hiding. Tormented by guilt and driven by ambition, Crow steals to fund his quest for redemption while honing his craft, all while evading bounty hunters sent by his kin to restore their honor and the Cult pursuing their stolen relic. His fear of both factions has made him increasingly cowardly, shunning the darker sides of his roguish abilities.<br><br>
When the Iron Wolves Organization, a guild, caught him attempting to steal from them, they offered redemption over punishment. Now a scout and guide for the guild, Crow channels his talents for their cause, seeking an honest path while haunted by his past.
